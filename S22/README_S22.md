## S21
**Objective: Training LLM in any cloud instances.**

Here I used Azure instance to run this.

We can view the loss in nohup.out file as:
iter 14900 step 7450: loss 3.3614, LR: 0.000007, iter time: 148.98ms
Saving checkpoint to 'out/redpajama/iter-015000-ckpt.pth'
Training time: 9053.25s
Memory used: 12.25 GB

Please go through the code and comments to get deeper intuitions.
